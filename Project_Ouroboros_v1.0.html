<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Lille (FR) / Family emigration from USSR (Serdtseva → Sancœur)</p>

<p><strong>Role:</strong> Field Operative; Retrieval &amp; Penetration Specialist; Later: Executive Assistant (Agreste)</p>

<p><strong>Competencies:</strong> Covert entry, cryptography, garment engineering, seam integrity (surgical grade), linguistic code-switching, controlled affect, martial arts, use of weaponry, high-pressure logistics.</p><figure class="photo-box"><img class="photo-box__img" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/093/197/542/large/ananya-unnikrishnan-nathalie-photo.jpg?1761845064" alt="Subject Photo — Nathalie Sancœur">

</figure><h2 class="section__title">II. EXECUTIVE SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p>Asset is a high-value, high-risk operative defined by pathological loyalty and self-erasure. Demonstrates exceptional technical and analytical prowess, particularly in textile engineering and covert penetration. Primary utility is as a force multiplier and stability anchor for high-dysfunction assets (see: AGRESTE, G.). Core vulnerability is a monomaniacal drive to preserve a self-defined "family unit," which overrides all self-preservation instincts. Requires active management to prevent operational degradation via starvation logic, sleep denial, and unilateral martyrdom. A precision instrument; handle with calibrated empathy and firm control protocols.</p><h2 class="section__title">III. BACKGROUND</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li>Street-level survival; brought in by G. Agreste &amp; E. Graham de Vanily (Lille). Early signs: lock bypass, caloric aversion, hypervigilance.</li>
<li>Tutoring appointment with House Graham de Vanily; outperforms academic gatekeeping; Primary evaluator (GRAHAM de VANILY, E.) records “dangerous composure.”</li>
<li>Assumes labor + design partnership at Friterie Grassette; demonstrated emergent genius in structural pattern engineering. Chronic malnutrition noted; compensates with hyper-precision.</li>
<li>Lethal engagements: Confirmed termination of Count Roderick (fountain, silenced). Historical, pre-Council mercy-kill of Claude Humbert (age ~13) following paternal assault. Consistently accepts reputational burden as a tactical shield for primary assets.</li>
<li>Documented progressive physical decline (severe anemia/internal hemorrhage); pattern of self-sacrifice behaviors (see: GRAHAM de VANILY Greenhouse Arson incident). Foreign "education" and exile led directly to Council intake and somatic remediation.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">IV. OPERATIONAL HISTORY</h2>

<p><strong>Operational Codename:</strong> THE SPECTOR</p>

<p><strong>Mission Profile:</strong> Excels in long-term penetration, asset retrieval, and logistical overwatch. Noted for flawless execution in high-stress environments and ability to maintain cover indefinitely.</p><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>OP-90-021 (Prague):</strong> Solo penetration of diplomatic embassy to secure target documentation. Neutralized three (3) security personnel; no trace left.</li>
<li><strong>OP-92-008 (Agreste Integration):</strong> Long-term placement as executive assistant to assets AGRESTE, G. &amp; E. Primary objective: monitor and guide Miraculous acquisition efforts. Ongoing.</li>
<li><strong>OP-97-015 (Rotterdam):</strong><span class="redact-black">██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</span><br />
<span class="redact-black">███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</span></li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">V. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Core Drives:</strong> Preservation of designated "family unit" (see AGRESTE); imposition of order via controlled environments; pathological refusal to be perceived as a burden (manifesting as self-erasure).</li>
<li><strong>Failure Modes:</strong> Starvation logic; sleep denial; unilateral martyrdom (verbatim: "My safety is secondary to the objective.").</li>
<li><strong>Affect:</strong> Blunted baseline. Intermittent cracking observed under direct, emotional pleas from juvenile assets (see VALE, R. &amp; M.) or when confronted with explicit moral mirrors.</li>
<li><strong>Susceptibilities:</strong> Sensory triggers related to food, hand hygiene, and left-handed stigma. Cues associated with paternal violence induce measurable stress responses.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">VI. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES &amp; AUGMENTATION</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Somatic Remediation:</strong> Full scarless dermal regeneration. Subdermal composites for increased durability and neural interface compatibility. Maintains strict Tsurugi-prescribed maintenance schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Exceptional aptitude in textile engineering and structural analysis. Professional-grade proficiency in covert entry and misdirection.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Discipline:</strong> Exemplary command-center discipline; capable of managing multi-channel comms, complex route trees, and redundancy planning. Willingness to employ kinetic solutions when deemed necessary for objective completion.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">VII. RISK / CONTROL</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> MEDIUM → HIGH when isolated. Risk spikes exponentially with jeopardy to AGRESTE assets. Lethal to operational adversaries; non-lethal to in-group, except towards self.</li>
<li><strong>Controls:</strong> Mandatory team embedding on all missions. Enforced nutrition and sleep cycles monitored by ANDERS, L. Dual-authorization required for solo operations. Regular debriefs with clinical, systems, and logic oversight.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">VIII. SELECT RELATIONSHIPS</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>AGRESTE, EMILIE:</strong> Primary "light-source object." Subject prioritizes Emilie's happiness and safety over mission orthodoxy and personal welfare. Highly susceptible to her persuasion.</li>
<li><strong>AGRESTE, GABRIEL:</strong> Co-dependent design dyad. Subject oscillates between idealization of his talent and corrective severity towards his instability. Routinely absorbs his emotional and strategic volatility to maintain operational integrity.</li>
<li><strong>BOURGEOIS, AUDREY:</strong> Professional rivalry with underlying mutual respect. BOURGEOIS perceives subject as a "ghostwriter," while subject recognizes BOURGEOIS as a necessary, if blunt, mirror. Interactions are transactional but efficient.</li>
<li><strong>GRASSETTE, GABRIELLE &amp; JOHNNY:</strong> Archetypal "mother" and "father" figures. Subject exhibits rare, genuine warmth and a sense of uncomplicated duty towards them. Views their well-being as a primary non-operational priority.</li>
<li><strong>GRAHAM DE VANILY, EMIL:</strong> Relationship defined by mutual respect forged through adversarial dialectic. The Duke recognizes her "dangerous composure"; she serves as his reluctant conscience and strategic counterweight at critical intervals.</li>

<li><strong>DE LA SANGRE, C.:</strong> Mentor archetype. Mutual recognition of necessary violence; Catalina executes where subject hesitates; A protective bond noted.</li>
<li><strong>STAHLBERG, G.:</strong> Maintains a strictly professional and clinical relationship. Mutual recognition as fellow analysts; communication is efficient and data-driven.</li>
<li><strong>SERDTSEV, V.:</strong> Biological father. Maintains strict professional distance in public. Physiological monitoring indicates significant stress response (elevated heart rate, cortisol) in his presence. Private interactions are minimal and characterized by a clear power disparity and clinical detachment and deference.</li>
<li><strong>ANDERS, L.:</strong> Primary debrief &amp; chess interlocutor. Subject demonstrates genuine, low-affect interest in his company. Shows minor displeasure at his "helicopter controls" but does not actively object, indicating a level of trust.</li>
<li><strong>TSURUGI, T.:</strong> Primary recruitment officer and caretaker. Initial subject assessment noted marked fear and hostility. This has transitioned to high-level respect and operational deference, correlating with subject's understanding of shared strategic goals. Relationship remains professional and task-oriented.</li>
<li><strong>PETRAKIS, T.:</strong><em> To be filled…</em></li>
<li><strong>VALE, R. &amp; M.:</strong><em> To be filled…</em></li>
<li><strong>General Note:</strong> Subject is perceived as "the Shadow"—universally pitied for her burdens, yet routinely utilized for her capabilities. Her condition is an open secret; proactive intervention remains inconsistent.</li>

</figure><h2 class="section__title">II. EXECUTIVE SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p>Asset is a high-value, low-volatility operative defined by a pathological drive for order and a profound rejection of human fallibility. Her utility is unparalleled in systems architecture and long-term strategic planning. Core vulnerability is a blind spot for chaotic, unpredictable human variables, which she attempts to solve with increasing layers of control. Her allegiance is to the Council's stated mission of global stability, which she interprets as the imposition of a perfect, machine-like order. A strict, samurai-derived honor code governs her actions; she requires a logical, defensible reason for all violence, making her predictable but occasionally obstructive to more expedient methods. She is a foundational pillar of the Assembly's operational infrastructure; her continued functionality is paramount. Handle with respect for her capabilities and a clear, logical rationale for all requests.</p><h2 class="section__title">III. BACKGROUND</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li>Raised in a traditional samurai household during Japan's economic boom; early indoctrination in bushidō codes of discipline and duty.</li>
<li>Inherited genetic mutations from hibakusha grandparents; childhood marked by chronic illness and social ostracization ("tainted blood"). Seed of antipathy for biological fragility planted early.</li>
<li>Diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (age ~13), a progressive blindness potentially linked to radiation exposure. Viewed as a "curse of the past," solidifying her resolve to transcend the flawed human body.</li>
<li>Intake during university years; provided resources to adapt to failing sight. Underwent self-designed neural interface surgeries, transforming disability into augmented perception.</li>
<li>During her transition to cybernetic perception, DE LA SANGRE personally retaught her swordsmanship, translating her traditional forms into a new, hyper-efficient style based on auditory and data-stream cues.</li>
<li>Founded Tsurugi Industries as a vehicle for her philosophy: the refinement of humanity through technology.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">IV. OPERATIONAL HISTORY</h2>

<p><strong>Operational Codename:</strong> THE MACHINE</p>

<p><strong>Mission Profile:</strong>Excels in long-term strategic system implementation, infrastructure fortification, and data hegemony. Not a primary field asset, but her systems underpin all field operations. Retains close-quarters combat proficiency for self-defense and sanctioned eliminations.</p><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>OP-89-012 (Tokyo):</strong> Orchestrated the systematic digital dismantling of a rival electronics conglomerate attempting to expose early Council financial interests. Employed stock manipulation algorithms and industrial espionage via proprietary data-harvesting firmware. Rival corporation declared bankruptcy within 11 months; key patents and personnel absorbed by Tsurugi Industries front companies.</li>
<li><strong>OP-91-031 (Kyoto):</strong> Neutralized a traditionalist political faction threatening to block legislative favors critical to Council infrastructure projects. Authored and deployed a targeted disinformation campaign, leveraging compromised personal data to discredit three primary opponents. The faction lost significant influence in the subsequent election cycle.
</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Custodian and primary architect of the Council's global surveillance and communications network. Oversees all cybernetic enhancements for field operatives.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">V. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Core Drives:</strong> The imposition of perfect, logical order to eradicate human suffering born of fragility and incompetence. Atonement for personal "genetic corruption" through the transcendence of the flesh.</li>
<li><strong>Failure Modes:</strong> Underestimation of illogical/emotional variables; argumentative non-compliance when presented with violent solutions she deems "without honor" or "unnecessary"; contempt for assets who fail to meet her efficiency standards.</li>
<li><strong>Affect:</strong> Professionally detached. Voice is a calibrated, neutral tone. Displays minor irritation at inefficiency and sentimentality. No observed emotional cracking.</li>
<li><strong>Susceptibilities:</strong> Triggers related to institutional incompetence, willful ignorance, and references to her handicaps or genetic history. Demonstrates a controlled but notable rise in stress biomarkers during interactions with SERDTSEV, V.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">VI. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES &amp; AUGMENTATION</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Somatic Remediation:</strong> Self-designed Tier-7 Perceptual Override System (SSG-01 "Shingan no Shinigami"). Replaces biological vision with multispectral data-stream interpretation. Includes advanced neural interfaces for sensory fusion, threat forecasting, and data analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Genius-level intellect in cybernetics, AI, and systems engineering. Masterful strategic planner. Maintains expert-level proficiency with bladed weapons, utilizing a unique style adapted for her cybernetic senses.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Discipline:</strong> Flawless. Her systems are the bedrock of Council logistics. Adheres strictly to protocol and her personal code, viewing them as the embodiment of order.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">VII. RISK / CONTROL</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> LOW. Asset is ideologically aligned with the Council's macro-goals and is physically dependent on her own systems, which are interwoven with our infrastructure. Primary risk is knowledge degradation should her health fail. Her honor code, while occasionally obstructive, also ensures predictability and prevents rogue action.</li>
<li><strong>Controls:</strong> Absolute integration within Council systems ensures mutual dependency. Regular system audits and maintenance are required for her survival, providing natural oversight. Social isolation is maintained; the Council is her sole outlet and purpose.</li>
</ul><h2 class="section__title">VIII. SELECT RELATIONSHIPS</h2><ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>TSURUGI, KIYOSHI &amp; SUMIYO:</strong> Architects of her core trauma. Relationship is a complex web of filial duty and profound ideological rejection. Retain significant influence as a non-Assembly control vector. Their continued advocacy for traditional societal compliance reliably induces predictable, if temporarily sub-optimal, behavioral modifications in the asset.</li>
<li><strong>SAITOU, YUZURU:</strong> <span class="redact-black">████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</span><br />

<li><strong>AGRESTE, GABRIEL:</strong> Civilian business contact engaged via Tsurugi Industries' textile innovation division. Asset's internal assessment characterizes him as "naive, thick-headed, and overambitious." However, she concedes a tolerance for his operational inefficiencies due to perceived genuine intent and raw, if undisciplined, talent.</li>

<li><strong>DE LA SANGRE, C.:</strong> Primary mentor and combat instructor. DE LA SANGRE's playful teasing is tolerated and appears to marginally improve subject's affect. Subject demonstrates a flicker of dry reciprocation and a degree of loyalty that occasionally supersedes strict protocol. Bond, forged during asset's perceptual transition period, provides significant psychological anchoring.</li>
<li><strong>STAHLBERG, G.:</strong> Professional respect. Relationship is efficient and data-driven. Subject appreciates and relates to STAHLBERG's analytical, unemotional approach. Interactions are brief and focused on shared operational objectives.</li>
<li><strong>SERDTSEV, V.:</strong> Antithesis and object of contempt. Views his methods as the brutal, chaotic, and dishonorable old world she seeks to replace. Interactions are minimal, cold, and professionally necessary. Physiological monitoring indicates significant stress response in his presence.</li>
<li><strong>ANDERS, L.:</strong> A respected, quasi-mentor figure. Relationship extends beyond mutual professional dependency. Subject demonstrates a quiet, attentive interest in his historical and scientific knowledge, often seeking him out for technical discussions.</li>
<li><strong>SANCŒUR N.:</strong> Protégé of sorts. Recognizes her genius and shared experience of being "remade." Treats her with a degree of clinical protectiveness as both a masterpiece and mirror.</li>
<li><strong>PETRAKIS, T.:</strong><em> To be filled…</em></li>
<li><strong>VALE, R. &amp; M.:</strong><em> To be filled…</em></li>
<li><strong>General Note:</strong> Subject is perceived as “part of the foundation" - universally respected for her intellect and reliability, but not feared. Her honorable, predictable nature and consistent, reason-based objections to unnecessary cruelty make her a stabilizing, if occasionally rigid and obstructive, presence. Her internal conflict with leadership is an open secret, but her value ensures it is overlooked.</li>
